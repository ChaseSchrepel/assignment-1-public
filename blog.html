        <h3>What came easy:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning HTML & Basic CSS</li>
            <li>Working with HTML and Managing some different variables with CSS</li>
            <li>Basic Page Management</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What were some difficulties:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Managing more advanced CSS systems like the background url for my photo</li>
            <li>I could not manage to get my Main title to be centered and highlighted with the knowledge taught in class.</li>
            <li>Managing specific combinations of CSS and HTML like for instance doing an inline highlight mixed with centering doesn't tend to 
                work without work arounds, and sometimes you can come to issues where if you miss one semicolon when making a global h1 color / italic etc 
                then it can just error out and not show any of the italics or highlights.

    <h3>"Benny's List" (CSS Edition)</h3>

    <h3>What came easy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Simple movement of items on the page</li>
        <li>Font Management </li>
        <li>Writing the code itself</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What were some difficulties:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> I accidentally had my screen set to 80% zoom for 95% of my writing of the program so I had to resize EVERYTHING</li>
        <li> Getting the actual benny's list banner to go completely black on top</li>
        <li> Remembering very small tips for some of the commands possible with CSS EX: how to properly use border</li>
    </ul>
