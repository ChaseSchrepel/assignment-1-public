        <h3>What came easy:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning HTML & Basic CSS</li>
            <li>Working with HTML and Managing some different variables with CSS</li>
            <li>Basic Page Management</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What were some difficulties:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Managing more advanced CSS systems like the background url for my photo</li>
            <li>I could not manage to get my Main title to be centered and highlighted with the knowledge taught in class.</li>
            <li>Managing specific combinations of CSS and HTML like for instance doing an inline highlight mixed with centering doesn't tend to 
                work without work arounds, and sometimes you can come to issues where if you miss one semicolon when making a global h1 color / italic etc 
                then it can just error out and not show any of the italics or highlights.
